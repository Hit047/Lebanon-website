        Chateau Ksara, the country’s oldest winery, began life in 1857 when
        Jesuit Fathers inherited and began farming a 25-hectare plot of land to
        produce Lebanon’s first non-sweet red wine. In doing so they laid the
        foundations of Lebanon’s modern wine industry. In 1973, the Vatican
        encouraged its monasteries and missions around the world to sell off any
        commercial activities. When then order to sell came through, the winery
        was optioned to a consortium of Lebanese businessmen.

        Bcharré, whose patron saint is Mar Seba [of Cappadocia], is a Lebanese
        town at 1,650 m of altitude, near the Kadisha Valley. The town is
        believed to derive its name from the Phonetician "Beit Esh-Shari"
        meaning "The House of Ishtar" - a goddess worshipped by the Phoenicians
        (and King Solomon) before monotheism.

        Harissa is a mountain village in Lebanon. The village, which is located
        650 meters above sea level, is home to an important Lebanese pilgrimage
        site, Our Lady of Lebanon. The village is located 20 km north of Beirut,
        and accessible from the coastal city of Jounieh either by road or by a
        nine-minute journey by a gondola lift, known as the “Téléférique”. It
        attracts both pilgrims and tourists who want to enjoy views of the bay
        of Jounieh. The pilgrimage site is a huge 15-ton bronze (and painted
        white) statue of Virgin Mary, known as Our Lady of Lebanon, with her
        arms outstretched. The statue was made at the end of the 19th century
        and inaugurated in 1908. Inside the statue’s base there is a small
        chapel. A huge modernistic Maronite cathedral built of concrete and
        glass stands right beside the statue.

        A paradise nestled in the heart of nature. It isn’t an ordinary lake
        which carries water or treasure, it’s a healing lake which carries life.
        Like any old Lebanese town, Chouwen, that beautiful old town in the
        north, has its culture, its traditional houses, its shops, and its food.
        However, there is one thing that makes Chouwen a special marvel in its
        own right, and earned it the nickname Jannat Chouwen or the “Chouwen
        Eden.” It goes beyond the beauty of a traditional Lebanese village. It
        is the dream place for hikers and nature lovers, and also for those who
        want to get to admire something unique.
